# PolicyAgent

> The Policy Agent was a project due to my bachelor degree in computer science, but the development has stopped, because I want to leave the restrictions I set on myself for this project to be able to create a more flexible approach.
> Development will continue under the new name EMS for Entity Management System. See https://github.com/Pfoerdie/EMS for further information.
